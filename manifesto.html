                        <p>fr fr there's a ghost story going viral in Europe rn - and it's the Communist ghost no cap üëª all these crusty old European powers formed a whole group chat to try exorcising this ghost:</p>

                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>the pope</li>
                            <li>the czar</li>
                            <li>Metternich and Guizot (name a more mid duo)</li>
                            <li>french radicals</li>
                            <li>german ops (aka police spies)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>like name ONE opposition party that hasn't been called "communist" by the powerful ones? find ONE opposition that hasn't thrown "communist" back as a drag against parties more progressive than them OR against their reactionary ops??</p>

                        <p>this tea leads to two MASSIVE conclusions:</p>

                        <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>all the European powers already know Communism is actually that power fr fr üò§</li>
                            <li>it's about time communists stop being shy and drop their own content. post the whole mission statement, goals, and general vibe check for everyone to see. time to respond to all these scary communist ghost stories with the actual communist group chat manifesto üì±</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>so the communist squad pulled up to London from different countries and wrote this Manifesto together. it's dropping in English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish</p>

                        <p>(basically going viral in every language fr) ‚ú®</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="space-y-6 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
                        <p>all of history is literally just different classes fighting each other, no cap.</p>

                        <p>look at these squad battles through history:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>free people vs slaves</li>
                            <li>fancy romans vs common romans</li>
                            <li>lords vs serfs</li>
                            <li>guild bosses vs workers</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>basically it's always been oppressors being toxic to the oppressed</p>

                        <p>this beef never stops - sometimes it's lowkey, sometimes it's straight up throwing hands. and it always ends in either:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>society getting completely rebooted</li>
                            <li>or everyone involved getting rekt</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>back in the day society was like a whole complicated tier list:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>ancient rome had: rich patricians, knights, regular people, slaves</li>
                            <li>medieval times had: lords, vassals, craft masters, workers, apprentices, peasants and each of those ranks had even more sub-ranks (literally a ranked competitive system fr) üéÆ</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>modern bourgeois society spawned from feudal society's ashes but didn't fix the class beef. it just made:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>new classes</li>
                            <li>new ways to oppress people</li>
                            <li>new types of fights</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>but here's what's different about our era (aka rich people era): they simplified the whole thing. society's splitting into two major opposing teams:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>the Bourgeoisie (team rich)</li>
                            <li>the Proletariat (team workers)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>and that's on periodt</p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-propaganda mt-12 mb-6">here's the villain origin story of the bourgeoisie üëÄ</h3>

                        <p>those medieval serfs leveled up into the first town citizens with actual rights. and from THOSE citizens, the first bourgeoisie started spawning (like a whole economic pokemon situation) üîÑ</p>

                        <p>then some MASSIVE world events dropped that gave the rising bourgeoisie their power spike:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>colonizers "finding" America (big yikes)</li>
                            <li>boats could go around africa now</li>
                            <li>new markets opened in india and china</li>
                            <li>america got colonized</li>
                            <li>trade with colonies started popping off</li>
                            <li>more stuff to buy and sell than ever before</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>all of this buffed:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>commerce (stonks üìà)</li>
                            <li>navigation grind</li>
                            <li>industry going brr</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>and basically helped the revolutionary faction in that mid feudal society level up FAST.</p>

                        <p>the feudal industry system was pure gatekeeping with closed guild monopolies?? but that wasn't meta anymore with these new markets wanting more. so the manufacturing update dropped instead.</p>

                        <p>the patch notes were wild fr fr:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>guild masters got ratioed by manufacturing middle class</li>
                            <li>instead of different guilds doing different things, single workshops started splitting up the labor</li>
                            <li>no more "this guild does this, that guild does that" meta</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>but the markets kept growing and demand went astronomical. manufacturing couldn't handle the pressure. then steam power and machines entered the chat and revolutionized everything üè≠</p>

                        <p>manufacturing got replaced by this absolute unit called Modern Industry, and the manufacturing middle class? replaced by industrial millionaires commanding whole armies of workers - the modern bourgeois faction spawned and immediately started being toxic fr fr.</p>

                        <p>modern industry created a worldwide market (america's discovery was the beta test). this global market made trade, shipping, and land travel go absolutely feral:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>industry leveled up</li>
                            <li>commerce expanded the map</li>
                            <li>navigation unlocked new routes</li>
                            <li>railways started going brr</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>= bourgeoisie faction getting more stacked, farming capital, and basically spawn camping every medieval class until they rage quit üíÄ</p>
                        <p>so basically the modern bourgeoisie is what happens when you stack enough development buffs and revolution patches to the production and exchange systems no cap.</p>

                        <p>and every time industry, trade, shipping, and railways expanded, rich people meta kept getting a political power spike too. their progression timeline looking like:</p>

                        <p>they nerfed personal value into pure exchange value. instead of all those different types of freedom builds that actually worked, they installed one broken mechanic: Free Trade (major L). basically they took exploitation (previously running religious and political skins) and made it raw, naked, brutal exploitation with zero cosmetics.</p>

                        <p>bourgeoisie went and removed admin privileges from every respected career build:</p>

                        <p>all got demoted to paid wage worker status, no cap.</p>

                        <p>they even ratio'd the family system - ripped away all the emotional textures and downgraded family relationships to pure monetary transactions</p>

                        <p>these rich folks can't even exist without constantly upgrading their production game fr fr. like, they HAVE to keep changing how everything works and that means society's whole vibe keeps shifting. meanwhile all those old timey worker fams were just trying to keep things exactly how they were, no changes needed. but these corporate overlords? they stay messing with the production line, making everything unstable and chaotic - literally cannot chill for one second smh. it's giving major different energy from how things used to be.</p>

                        <p>everything that used to be set in stone? yeet. all those crusty old traditions and opinions everyone thought were facts? straight up deleted. and whenever something new comes along it's already giving outdated before anyone can even post about it. everything solid just poofs into thin air like it's being thanos snapped, everything sacred gets ratio'd, and humans finally gotta face the real tea about their lives and how they connect with other people - no filters.</p>

                        <p>the rich taking their whole "must expand markets" thing way too seriously rn - literally speed running across the entire planet üíÄ they got that "gotta catch em all" mindset, tryna set up shop and make connections everywhere like it's some global networking speedrun challenge.</p>

                        <p>these corporate overlords went and made everything worldwide with their market shenanigans ong. production and buying stuff? totally globalized now. the haters stay mad but facts don't care - they yanked the whole national foundation right out from under manufacturing. all those old school industries getting rekt daily, replaced by new ones that got nations fighting for their lives to keep up. and these new industries? they're not even using local materials anymore, they're reaching across the whole map for resources like they're playing some resource management sim.</p>

                        <p>everything they make gets consumed literally everywhere - local markets are so last season. instead of being satisfied with what's made nearby, everyone's got cravings for stuff from the other side of the planet fr. that old "we keep to ourselves" energy? completely ghosted. now everyone's all up in everyone else's business - every nation depends on every other nation and that's just how it be.</p>

                        <p>and it's not just about physical stuff either - it's big brain time too. when someone comes up with smart ideas in one place, those ideas belong to everyone now. can't even be narrow-minded about your own country anymore - that's cringe. instead of having separate literature for every nation, we're getting this whole worldwide library situation.</p>

                        <p>they got every nation in a chokehold fr - either join their production style or get deleted from the game. they're like "time to get civilized" but what they really mean is "become exactly like us or else." basically creating a whole world that's just a copy-paste of themselves.</p>

                        <p>rich folks really said "rural areas? mid" and made everything about cities. built these massive urban zones, pulled everyone from the countryside into their concrete jungle meta. acting like they saved people from some NPC farming lifestyle tbh. now the countryside can't even function without cities anymore - it's giving dependent relationship vibes. same energy with how they made less developed nations rely on the "civilized" ones, peasant countries simping for bourgeois nations, and the East getting carried by the West.</p>

                        <p>the rich really speedrunning the elimination of scattered populations and resources fr. they said "time to consolidate everything" and straight up compressed all production and property into their tiny squad's inventory. and ofc that made politics go full centralized mode too üíÄ</p>

                        <p>all those independent provinces with their own unique gameplay mechanics? nah fam. got merged into one mega server with shared rules, one government, one law system, and one class interest - everything standardized like they're playing on default settings.</p>

                        <p>in just a century these corporate overlords created more production power than literally everyone before them combined - that's actually kinda cracked. they really went and:</p>

                        <p>like which past generation could even imagine these production stats were possible? absolutely zero of them.</p>

                        <p>but plot twist: all these production methods the rich used to level up? they originally came from feudal society's tech tree. at some point tho, the feudal gameplay mechanics couldn't handle these new production methods - straight up became debuff status effects. those old feudal property rules were basically running on legacy code that needed to get deleted. and deleted they got.</p>

                        <p>free competition said "it's my turn on the xbox" and rolled up with its whole political setup buffing the rich squad's power levels.</p>

                        <p>and rn? same energy happening irl. modern rich society with all its production and trade mechanics summoned these absolute unit production methods but they're giving major sorcerer's apprentice vibes - can't even control the power they unlocked üíÄ</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-propaganda mt-12 mb-6">The Crisis Events Keep Spawning üåã</h3>

                        <p>for decades the whole industry storyline has just been these new production methods throwing hands with modern production rules - especially the property rules that let the rich stay in power. just look at those economic crisis events that keep spawning more often, each time threatening to delete the whole rich society from existence.</p>

                        <p>during these crisis events? massive chunk of products get thrown in the trash, even the machines that make them get destroyed. and the most cursed part? there's literally TOO MUCH stuff being made - that would've been considered actual brain damage in earlier times. society suddenly gets hit with that temporary barbarism debuff, acting like some mega famine or war just nuked all the resources. industry and trade looking absolutely rekt... and for what? because everything's TOO advanced, TOO many resources, TOO much industry, TOO much trade happening.</p>

                        <p>all these production methods aren't even helping rich property rules anymore - they're way too OP for the current meta. when they break free from these limits they cause total chaos in rich society, putting rich property rights in danger mode. rich society's rules are too smol brain to handle all this wealth they created.</p>

                        <p>and how do the rich deal with these crisis events? toxic strat fr:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                            <li>straight up destroying tons of production power</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>basically setting up even bigger and more destructive crisis events later while making it harder to prevent them. absolute smooth brain moves tbh.</p>

                            <p>but wait there's more - the rich didn't just craft weapons for their own game over, they literally spawned the players who gonna use them: the working class squad aka the proletarians.</p>

                            <p>every time the rich level up their capital, they also level up the working class - except these players only stay alive if they can find work, and only find work if they make the rich richer. mega cursed setup tbh. workers gotta sell themselves piece by piece like they're items in the shop, getting hit with all that competition RNG and market changes.</p>

                            <p>thanks to all these machines and divided labor meta, working just lost all its character customization options - totally boring for the workers now. they basically became machine DLC, only needing the most basic button-mashing skills. that's why a worker's production cost is basically just whatever keeps them alive and lets them have kids to make more workers later.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-propaganda mt-12 mb-6">The Pay-to-Win Meta Gets Worse üí∞</h3>

                            <p>and here's the real toxic part: item price equals production cost, and that includes labor too. so the more soul-crushing the work gets, the less money workers make üíÄ and it gets worse - more machines and divided labor = more grinding required. longer work hours, more tasks per hour, faster machines - straight up getting spawn camped by the grind.</p>

                            <p>modern industry really said "small workshop? cringe" and transformed everything into these mega factories. workers get packed in there like they're in some twisted battle royale map, organized like an NPC army with try-hard managers as their squad leaders.</p>

                            <p>these players aren't just getting owned by the rich class and their pay-to-win state - they're getting spawn camped 24/7 by machines, supervisors, and especially those factory owner whales. and the more these owners flex about making bank being their only goal, the more toxic and rage-inducing the whole setup gets üíÄ</p>

                                    <li>age and gender straight up stopped mattering for the working class</li>
                                    <li>everyone's just seen as tools with different price tags based on their stats</li>

                            <p>and the moment workers escape the factory owner's exploitation by getting their cash drops, they get jumped by the rest of the rich squad - landlords, shop owners, and those predatory loan sharks all wanting their share of the loot.</p>

                            <p>but these noobs aren't even targeting the right thing - instead of attacking the rich's production methods, they're out here rage quitting on the machines themselves. destroying imported items that compete with their work, smashing equipment, setting factories on fire - trying to force reset the game back to medieval server settings.</p>

                            <p>at this point the working class is basically playing solo battle royale, scattered everywhere and getting griefed by their own competition meta. when they do make squads, it's not even their own strat - it's the rich players forcing them to group up for their own political speedruns. rich squad can still control these movements rn bc they're the only ones who know the meta.</p>

                            <p>so these working class players aren't even fighting their actual opponents yet - they're just being used as NPCs in the rich squad's fights against:</p>

                            <p>machines keep getting buffed way too fast, making workers' survival chances straight up pepega. and what started as 1v1s between workers and rich players is now looking like full-on faction warfare.</p>

                            <p>this is the network diff they needed to turn all these scattered local beefs into one massive class vs class battle royale. and every class battle is automatically political pvp. medieval workers needed centuries to build alliances with their scuffed transportation tech, but modern workers? they got railways and did it in a few years - absolutely cracked.</p>

                            <p>working class players keep trying to organize into one mega faction and political party but their own competition mechanics keep griefing their progress. still, they keep respawning stronger each time, like some raid boss that just won't stay down üíÄ they even exploit the rich squad's internal drama to force new worker protection patches - like that 10-hour workday update in England.</p>
